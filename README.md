# Draw-It-or-Lose-It

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**<br>

* The Gaming Room is a company who asked us to extend their mobile game Draw It or Lose it to be cross platform. They wanted us to design the application for the server and give a recommendation for an operating system to run on.
  Each game instance can have multiple teams and each team is given a set time to answer correctly before the next team can steal their points. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**<br>

* 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**<br>

* I found that the processes of updating the UML diagram was helpful because its a really easy way to get a good view of how peices of the code are connected.
  When making recommendations for the client I believe that critical thinking helped me ask different types of questions about the problem to further research and expand my knowledge.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**<br>

* I would go back and revise the recommendation section that explains the linux architecture. I want to explore more on what other benefits servers can get from the linux architecture other then just being cheaper then windows and mac OS'es.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**<br>

* Creating a design document is important because there are different types of solutions to problems and making sure your implementation is what the user actually wants before you spend time and money developing code.
   The clients needs effects desisns like code patterns, security requirements, storage, and memory reuqirements. An example is that the client wanted teams and usernames to be unique so on an object initiation we have to first check if that
  object already existed. Only one instance of the game meaning that the signleton pattern fit best for the game object.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**<br>
